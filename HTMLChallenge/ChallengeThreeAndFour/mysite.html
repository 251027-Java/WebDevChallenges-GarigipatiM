                Hi! My name is Manasvini Garigipati, but I also go by Manu. I am a Java full stack software developer. I graduated from UTD with a Bachelors in CS this year and I'm also an Oracle Certified Associate Java Programmer. My technical experience includes Java and SQL as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy learning new technologies and leveraging them to build reliable and efficient applications. I'm interested in application design and learning about the end-to-end perspective of the software engineering process.
